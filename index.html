				<h1 id="bioHeader">Only when you have experienced your darkness can you live fully in your light</h1>
				<p>This is the core tenet behind the music of Midnight Daughter, Seattle-based rock-folk duo. Evocative and haunting, piercing and chilling, their music stirs and unsettles, releases and awakens. From the hovering ballad to the piercing rock track, their music calls to the parts of us that we are shutting out, the pieces of our soul left in darkness and desolation.</p>
				<p>The source of the music comes from lead vocalist Aurora Smedley's experience with severe depression and her journey for recovery. A journey that encompassed hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, spiritual experiences with psychedelics, and intensive healing work, and which culminated in a vision of a warrior that compelled her to return to Seattle for music.</p>
				<p>In Seattle, she crossed paths with Bryan Djunaedi, a classically-trained violinist steeped in cross-genre improvisation. Together, the duo combines searing vocal prowess with virtuosic fiddle-shredding to weave a cathartic and transformative experience.</p>
				<p>Within two months of their inception, they were invited to play live on KISW 99.9, Seattle's Rock Station. The group is now working on their debut album.</p>
